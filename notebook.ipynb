    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the power of probabalistic models. You will build a word recognizer for American Sign Language (ASL) video sequences. In particular, this project employs hidden Markov models (HMM's) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In each video, an ASL signer is signing a meaningful sentence. In a typical ASL recognition system, you observe the XY coordinates of the speaker's left hand, right hand, and nose for every frame. The following diagram shows how the positions of the left hand (Red), right hand (Blue), and nose (Green) change over time in video number #66. Saturation of colors represents time elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./demo/hands_nose_position.png\" alt=\"hands nose position\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, for the sake of simplicity, you will only use the Y-coordinates of each hand to construct your HMM. In Part 1 you will build a one dimensional model, recognizing words based only on a series of right-hand Y coordinates; in Part 2 you will go multidimensional and utilize both hands. At this point, you will have two observed coordinates at each time step (frame) representing right hand & left hand Y positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words you will be recognizing are \"BUY\", \"HOUSE\", and \"CAR\". These individual signs can be seen in the sign phrases from our dataset:\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal here will be to use the HMM derived from Part 1a (states, prior probabilities, transition probabilities, and parameters of emission distribution) to build a viterbi trellis.  When provided with an evidence vector (list of observed right-hand Y coordinates), the function will return the most likely sequence of states that generated the evidence and the probabilty of that sequence being correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an evidence vector [36, 44, 52, 53, 49, 44] should output a sequence ['B1', ... 'B2', ... 'B3']\n",
    "\n",
    "If no sequence can be found, the algorithm should return one of the following tuples:\n",
    "`(None, 0)` (null),  `([], 0)` (empty list) or  `(['C1', 'C1', ... 'C1'],0)` (Or all being the first state of that letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No sequence can be found\" means the probability reaches 0 midway. If you find an incomplete sequence with some probability, output that sequence with its probability. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Hint:\n",
    "In order to reconstruct your most-likely path after running Viterbi, you'll need to keep track of a back-pointer at each state, which directs you to that state's most-likely predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to use the provided function `gaussian_prob` to compute  emission probabilities. Although in real work, you have to convert the probability to log-base in order to prevent digit underflow, in this assignment, we will only test your function against a rather short sequence of observations, so **DO NOT** convert the probability to logarithmic probability, otherwise you will fail the tests on Gradescope.\n",
